## Description

This project gives a demonstration of a photo sharing site that is responsive to different device sizes. Currently, this project allows the user to view several different images belonging to a certain profile. There is an option to edit the profile, add new photos, or like the existing photos. While these options are available, they currently do not do anything. In future projects we will be tying the buttons to further functionality.
